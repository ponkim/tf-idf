        Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all; let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage; find me to marry me with Octavius Cæsar, and companion me with my mistress.

        My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,

<PRINCE>        <4%>
        Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
        Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
        Will they not hear? What ho! you men, you beasts,
        That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
        With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
        On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
        Throw your mis-temper'd weapons to the ground,
        And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
        Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
        By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
        Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
        And made Verona's ancient citizens
        Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
        To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
        Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
        If ever you disturb our streets again
        Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
        For this time, all the rest depart away:
        You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
        And, Montague, come you this afternoon
        To know our further pleasure in this case,
        To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
        Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
</PRINCE>
